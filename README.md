# Jupyter Setup

After running multiple Python training workshops with [Python Charmers](https://pythoncharmers.com/) where we have extensively used Jupyter notebooks we found that certain Jupyter configurations were a substantial improvement over the defaults.

## Usage

Just load in the file at `config.py` into your notebook and run it.

Now you will be ready to go!
